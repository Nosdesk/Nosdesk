## Shared Fluent message catalogue for en-US.
##
## Loaded by both the Rust backend (via include_str! in
## backend/src/utils/i18n.rs) and the Vue frontend (via Vite glob
## import in frontend/src/i18n/index.ts). The .ftl format is
## Mozilla's Fluent. Keep keys kebab-case, group by feature
## prefix (e.g. password-reset-*, ticket-*) so call sites stay
## predictable.

unread-count = { $count ->
    [0] No new messages.

# Acme Helpdesk Password" rather than the literal product name.

# Password-reset email body. The HTML strings carry inline
# <strong> tags for typographic emphasis; translators preserve
# them as opaque markers around the words they wrap. The plain-
# text variant is one Fluent multi-line value so translators see
# the full prose at once. $name and $app are already HTML-escaped
# by the caller in HTML contexts and passed raw in plaintext.
